# SAR Soil Moisture Index

SAR Soil Moisture Index was developed at Geomatrix UAB (Lithuania) for detection and mapping of
high soil moisture in low-vegetation and bare soil areas – presumably, regular seasonal floods and
occasional hazardous summer-time floods affecting agriculture. SAR Soil Moisture index is computed
from analysis-ready Sentinel-1 polarimetry SAR data, produced by SAGRIS software toolbox as
calibrated, orthorectified, flattened and cloud-optimised 16-bit raster datasets. Methodology is based on
SAR polarisation ratio, combined with direct classification of back-scatter signal values, which allows
detection of a wide range of flooding conditions – from highly saturated soils to temporary water bodies
standing is agriculture fields. Combination of different computation methods allows detection of
excessive water both on bare soil and under the coverage of crops, unless vegetation is too massive for the
C-band radar signal to penetrate (e.g. woody vegetation, corn fields, etc.). 

SAR Soil Moisture index contains a combined set of polarisation ratios and coded values, which have the following practical
meanings:
- 0–9: Low-to-moderate soil moisture (saturation), which poses no threat to heavy machinery, yet
practical farming operations are likely to be disturbed when values reach above 5;
- 10–50: High soil moisture (complete saturation) with water accumulating on soil surface below
vegetation cover. Physical access to fields and routine farming activities are not possible;
- 50–100: Partial flooding of fields with vegetation partially submerged. This is a hazardous
condition, potentially causing a substantial loss of crops;
- 100–200: Complete flooding of fields with open water bodies and completely submerged
vegetation. This is a force majeure condition, definitely causing a complete loss of crops and
disturbing further activities of the farming cycle, thus impacting the next year harvest.
